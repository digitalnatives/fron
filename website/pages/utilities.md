# 5. Utilities
Fron provides a few **utility classes** by default:

* **Request** - Making and handling requests
* **LocalStorage** - LocalStorage wrapper
* **Keyboard** - Adding and handling shortcuts
* **Drag** - Low level dragging support

These classes are not connected to the interfaces directly but helps you solve a lot
of issues that generally come up for web applications.
