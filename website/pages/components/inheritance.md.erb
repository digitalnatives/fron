# 4.1. Inheritance
Because **components** are just **ruby classes**, that means that they can be exteded
and reused.

Let's say that there is a **Button** component that greets you when you click it,
and we would like to have an icon before the text, but it doesn't support that:

<%= example 'MyButton' %>

What we can do is to create an **IconButton** component that extends the **Button** component,
and add the functionality to that:

<%= example 'IconButton' %>

What we did was:
* we extended the **Button** component so the events, styles and methods are inherited
* we added two components one for the **icon** and one for the **text (span)**
* we delegated the two methods **text** and **text=** in order to not break the API
* we added some styles to the **icon** component
