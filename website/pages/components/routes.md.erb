# 4.4. Routes
Routing is supported in Fron via the **Fron::Behaviors::Routes** module, and
currently is very sparse.

When used in a **component**, routes can be defined in order to call an
_instance method_ when the page location changes to match a perticular
regular expression or string:

```ruby
class Main < Fron::Component
  include Fron::Behaviors::Routes

  route '/users', :users
  route '/posts', :posts

  def users
    # Display users
  end

  def posts
    # Display posts
  end
end
```

## Handling Parameters

If capture groups are defined for the regular expression than they will be
forwarded to the method as arguments:

```ruby
class Main < Fron::Component
  include Fron::Behaviors::Routes

  route '/users/(.*)', :show_user

  def show_user(id)
    # Display user with the given id
  end
end
```

Things to keep in mind when handling routes:
* Multiple components can include this module and define routes
* If multiple components matches a route then only one (the first) will
  be called
* Components that are not in the DOM can handle routes too
* The best practice is to have one component to handle all the routes and then
  delegate down the component tree
