# 4.2. Composition
Components can be composited together with the **component** DSL method.
This allows you to create more complex components like this paragraph component:

<%= example 'ImageParagraph' %>

As you can see the components we defined (**image** and **content**) are accessible with
**instance variables** also with **instance methods** but only if there is no method
defined with that name.
