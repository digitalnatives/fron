# 4.3. Events
Handling events are pretty easy by using the **on** DSL method in a component: when an **event**
happens the given **instance method** should be called.

There are two ways of adding events:
* Adding events directly to the component is used if you don't care about which child component triggered
  the event, or the event isn't delegateable like **focus** or **blur**:
  ```ruby
  on :blur, :close
  ```
* Delegating events with a **selector** is usefull if you only want to handle events
  that were trigger child components matching that selector.
  ```ruby
  on :click, 'button > span', :open
  ```

For example let's say there is a component for converting **celsius** to **fahrenheit**:

<%= example 'Converter' %>
