# 5.2. Local Storage

*Notice: Only the LocalStorage is implemented, we plan to implement SessionStorage and CookieStorage with the same interface.*

This utility is for storing things in [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) you can see the API documentation [here](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/digitalnatives/fron/master/Fron/Storage/LocalStorage).

It implements the following class methods:
* **all** - Returns all keys and their values in a hash
* **clear** - Clears all keys
* **get(key)** - Get the value of the given key
* **remove(key)** - Removes the given key
* **set(key, value)** - Sets the given value to the given key

As an example the contents of this textarea persists between reloads:

<%= example 'TextArea' %>
